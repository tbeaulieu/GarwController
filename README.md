This is a simple GARW iOS mostly "vibe coded" app (I'm not an iPhone dev) based upon Dustin Sterkenburg's node.js script. I added a few sounds and made a very basic interface so far. 

iOS apps die after 7 days to prevent sideloading, so you have to rebuild + connect every so often.

If it's not changing anything, force quit the app and reload it, making sure you're on the GARW wifi.
